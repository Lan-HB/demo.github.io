Having undergone joint training in engineering and design courses, I possess both the logical rigor of an engineer and the comprehensive delicacy of a designer. I continuously advance with keen observation, boundless creativity, and strong execution ability. I have a passion for human-computer interaction and a profound interest in pervasive computing and edge computing, deeply recognizing their value and significance. I aspire to contribute to this field in the future, making breakthroughs and innovations against the backdrop of interdisciplinary integration, and growing into an outstanding T-shaped talent.
